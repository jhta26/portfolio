- Architected and deployed RESTful API with Node.js and Express with data persistence using PostgreSQL DB; deployed backend to AWS using EC2 and Elastic Beanstalk.
- Implemented Google Maps, Google Directions, and Geocoding API’s and Socket.io to update locations in real time, allowing users to see exactly how far away friends are from destination.
- Used TDD with Jest and Enzyme for front end and supertests for REST API calls, achieving 80% code coverage.
